# Close an issue from a commit in a different repository

It is possible to put "Closes #123" in a commit message; once it gets merged in
`master`, the issue will be closed automatically.

This feature can also be used to close an issue in a different repository using
"Closes user/repo#123" (obviously you need push access to that repository).

See [the docs](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.13/user/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords#closing-an-issue-in-a-different-repository).
